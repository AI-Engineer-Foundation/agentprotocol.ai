## Clients

- [AutoGPT UI](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/tree/master/frontend) - Flutter app designed to facilitate users in discussing various tasks with a single agent.

## Tools

- [Benchmarking](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT-Benchmarks) - An agent protocol client built for the purpose of benchmarking the performance of agents far and wide, regardless of how they are set up and how they work.
- [SDK](https://github.com/AI-Engineers-Foundation/agent-protocol-sdk-python/tree/main) - A SDK for Agent Protocol written in Python and JS/TS. You can also find more in [SDK](/sdks/)
- [Client](https://github.com/AI-Engineers-Foundation/agent-protocol/tree/main/client/python) - A client for Agent Protocol written in Python. You can also find more in [Clients](/clients/)
