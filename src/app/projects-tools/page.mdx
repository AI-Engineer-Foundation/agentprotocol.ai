# Project and tools

This is an overview of projects and tools using Agent Protocol.

## Agents

- [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT) - An experimental open-source attempt to make GPT-4 fully autonomous
- [Smol developer](https://github.com/smol-ai/developer) - Your own junior developer

## Tools

- [Benchmarking](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT-Benchmarks) - A repo built for the purpose of benchmarking the performance of agents far and wide, regardless of how they are set up and how they work
- [SDK](https://github.com/AI-Engineers-Foundation/agent-protocol-sdk-python/tree/main) - A SDK for Agent Protocol written in Python and JS/TS. You can also find more in [SDK](/sdks/)
- [Client](https://github.com/AI-Engineers-Foundation/agent-protocol/tree/main/client/python) - A client for Agent Protocol written in Python. You can also find more in [Clients](/clients/)
- [AutoGPT Forge](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/tree/master/autogpts/forge) - The building blocks for an AutoGPT-style agent using the Agent Protocol.

### Idea for contribution

- UI for Agent Protocol - A simple web UI that allows you to communicate with agents instead of CLI
